alright buster. Cloudcoils shit design is kicking your ass again. Cloudcoil inside

https://github.com/cloudcoil/cloudcoil/blob/main/cloudcoil/codegen/templates/pydantic_v2/BaseModel.jinja2

imports ConfigDict.jinja2.. which isnt even commited to its source

thats why you were generating it earlier, not just because you wanted extra fields
because its required in order for the generator to run.. and there are no examples
in cloudcoils source of even using this file.. cooooooool. What an ass lib.

buck2 and nix (nixes uv2nix venv) is readonly so we cant just do this 

tmpl_dir = Path(str(files("cloudcoil.codegen"))) / "templates" / "pydantic_v2"

as we did in the old one. And write the jinja to it. 


Your gonna need to experiment with gpt to figure out how to address that. Night bro.
